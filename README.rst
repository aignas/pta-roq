This is my summer project on Pulsar Timming Array data fitting using Reduced Order
Quadrature methods

These are the list of things that need to be done:

1. Write a simple model generating data for single sources

   a) evenly spaced time sampling 1 pulsar

   b) not evenly spaced 1 pulsar

   c) not evenly spaced several pulsars

   d) add white noise

   e) add red noise

2. Check out the package to generate PTA
   data
