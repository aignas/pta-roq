This is my summer project on Pulsar Timming Array data fitting using Reduced Order
Quadrature methods

TODO
===

These are the list of things that need to be done:

    1. Write a simple model generating data for single sources

        a) evenly spaced sampling 1 pulsar

        b) not evenly spaced 1 pulsar

        c) not evenly spaced several pulsars

        d) add white noise

        e) add red noise

    2. Check out the package to generate PTA data
